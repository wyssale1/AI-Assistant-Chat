{"query": "But how does this valve in principle works?", "timestamp": 1741952948.019867, "response": "The SMC auto drain valve operates based on changes in pressure within a bowl to manage condensate drainage. Here's a concise explanation of its working principle:\n\n1. **When Pressure is Released Inside the Bowl**:\n   - The diaphragm (\u2466) is lowered by spring (\u2465), interrupting the sealing action of the main valve (\u2469).\n   - Outside air flows into the bowl (\u2460) through chamber hole (\u2468) and drain cock (\u246a).\n   - Any accumulated condensate in the bowl drains out through the drain cock (\u246a).\n\n2. **When Pressure is Applied Inside the Bowl**:\n   - If pressure exceeds 0.1 MPa, the diaphragm (\u2466) moves upward due to force surpassing that of spring (\u2465).\n   - This action pushes the main valve (\u2469) up, sealing off the bowl from outside air.\n   - In absence of condensate accumulation, float (\u2461) is pulled down by its weight, causing valve (\u2463), connected to lever (\u2462), to seal valve seat (\u2464).\n\n3. **When There is an Accumulation of Condensate in the Bowl**:\n   - The float (\u2461) rises due to buoyancy and opens the seal created by valve seat (\u2464).\n   - Pressure inside the bowl enters tube (\u2467), lowering diaphragm (\u2466) via spring (\u2465).\n   - This interrupts the main valve's sealing action, allowing condensate to drain through the drain cock (\u246a).\n   - Manually turning the drain cock counterclockwise can also facilitate drainage by opening the seal created by the main valve.\n\n4. **When Pressure is Released**:\n   - Even with pressure release inside the bowl, spring (\u2465) keeps diaphragm (\u2466) in an upward position to maintain sealing action.\n\nThis mechanism ensures effective condensate management based on internal pressure changes within the system.\n\n*Source: om_ad402_afx_omu0038en.pdf, Page 6, Page 11, Page 7, Page 11, Page 11, Page 11*"}
