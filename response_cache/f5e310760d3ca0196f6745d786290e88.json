{"query": "Which series or models do you have a knowledge for?", "timestamp": 1741963450.3087108, "response": "Based on the provided context excerpts from the documentation, I can provide information about several models within the ZHV series of vacuum pumps:\n\n1. **ZHV10**: \n   - Suction flow rate: 72.7 (units not specified)\n   - Discharge flow rate: 34 (units not specified)\n   - Air consumption: 19 (units not specified)\n   - Fluid passage diameter: 12.2 and 16.2 (units not specified)\n\n2. **ZHV20**: \n   - Suction flow rate: 119\n   - Discharge flow rate: 55\n   - Air consumption: 32\n   - Fluid passage diameter: 18.5 and 23.5\n\n3. **ZHV30**: \n   - Suction flow rate: 157.3\n   - Discharge flow rate: 64\n   - Air consumption: 20\n   - Fluid passage diameter: 22.5 and 28.5\n\n4. **ZHV40**: \n   - Suction flow rate: 201.5\n   - Discharge flow rate: 87\n   - Air consumption: 25\n   - Fluid passage diameter: 27.2 and 33.5\n\nThese models are part of the ZHV series, which indicates variations in design or specifications ([document], Page 6). The specific operational principles involve creating a vacuum to draw air through filters, establishing negative pressure inside the chamber ([document], Page 1).\n\nI don't have information on any other series or models beyond what is provided in these excerpts.\n\n**Sources:**\n**ZHV-A_EU.pdf**\n* Page 1\n* Page 3\n* Page 6"}
